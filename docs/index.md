# Compose Documentation

Welcome to the Compose framework documentation. Here you will find everything you need to install the framework, understand how the middleware pipeline works, configure services, and build pages with the built-in Plates view engine.

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) – Install the package and scaffold a minimal application.
- [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) – Detailed explanation of the configuration array.
- [HTTP Pipeline](http-pipeline.md) – How middleware, routing, and events fit together.
- [Views & Pages](views-and-pages.md) – Rendering templates, code-behind pages, and helpers.
- [Service Container](service-container.md) – Registering services, factories, and leveraging autowiring.

## Beta 1.4 RC

Compose 1.4 introduces a refreshed configuration story, improved middleware orchestration, and a more powerful pages module. All examples in this documentation assume the beta 1.4 RC build unless noted otherwise.
