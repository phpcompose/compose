# Compose Documentation

Welcome to the Compose framework documentation. Here you will find everything you need to install the framework, understand how the middleware pipeline works, configure services, and build applications around the Pages middleware (the primary feature).

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) – Install the package and scaffold a minimal application.
- [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) – Detailed explanation of the configuration array.
- [HTTP Pipeline](http-pipeline.md) – How middleware, routing, and events fit together.
- [Views & Pages](views-and-pages.md) – Rendering templates, code-behind pages, and helpers.
- [Service Container](service-container.md) – Registering services, factories, and leveraging autowiring.

## 1.0.0 RC1

Compose 1.0.0-rc1 finalizes the refreshed configuration story, improved middleware orchestration, and enhanced pages module introduced during the 1.0 development cycle. All examples in this documentation assume the 1.0.0-rc1 build unless noted otherwise.
